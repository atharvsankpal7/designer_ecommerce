# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a Mongoose schema registration error when trying to populate the Section model in Product queries. The error "Schema hasn't been registered for model 'Section'" occurs when the API tries to fetch products with populated section data. This issue needs to be resolved to ensure proper model relationships and data retrieval functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Mongoose models to be properly registered and available for population operations, so that API endpoints can successfully retrieve related data without schema registration errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API route `/api/products` is called THEN the Section model SHALL be properly registered and available for populate operations
2. WHEN Product.find().populate('sectionId') is executed THEN the operation SHALL complete successfully without MissingSchemaError
3. WHEN multiple API requests are made concurrently THEN all model schemas SHALL remain consistently registered

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized model registration system, so that all Mongoose models are initialized in the correct order and dependencies are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database connection is established THEN all required models SHALL be registered before any database operations
2. WHEN models have references to other models THEN the referenced models SHALL be registered first
3. WHEN the application starts THEN model registration SHALL happen automatically without manual intervention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want product queries to return complete data including section information, so that the frontend can display products with their associated categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching products with `GET /api/products` THEN the response SHALL include populated section data
2. WHEN products are filtered by section THEN the section relationship SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN the API returns product data THEN the section name SHALL be included in the response structure
